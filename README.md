### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm working on improving developer experience with Pixel and Tonic (the creators of [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com)) by making local development with Docker simple with [Nitro](https://getnitro.sh). 

### Languages

I spend the majoirty of my time in Go and PHP but also enjoying learning new languages like Rust.

### Projects

- [Craft Nitro](https://getnitro.sh) - A local Docker development environment for PHP without learning Docker.
